# LeetBot

LeetBot is a Discord bot that scrapes Leetcode user profiles and updates progress in real time. It is currently made to be self-hosted, see the [setup section below](https://github.com/48nes/leetbot#how-to-host) for how to host.

## About

LeetBot is written entirely in Python and uses PostgreSQL for database management. The API we used can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/ashdawngary/Leetcode-userapi).

## Commands and Features

LeetBot's main feature is a live feed of all users' recent Leetcode submissions. The bot is currently set up to check for new submissions every 30 seconds, although this can be adjusted in `bot.py`.

## How to Host

Currently, we use [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) to run our version of the bot, but any alternative should work as well. This how-to will go over setting up using Heroku.

#### Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application
2. In the Build a Bot tab, create a new bot. Where it says `TOKEN`, click copy to get the bot token and save this somewhere.
3. Go to the OAuth2 tab. Under Scopes, choose bot and under Bot Permissions choose Administrator. Copy the URL given under the Scopes section, you can now use this URL to add the bot to your servers.

#### Leetcode Setup

1. Create a dummy account on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) with the same username and password. Save this somewhere.

#### Heroku Setup

1. Fork this repo.
2. Log into [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) using your Github account
3. Create a new application by clicking on New and then App
4. In Deploy, set Deployment method to Github and choose the forked repository
5. Under Automatic deploys, enable automatic deploys
6. Go back up to Settings. Under Config Vars, click reveal and add the bot token generated from Discord with `BOT_TOKEN` as the key and the bot token as the value.
7. Add another config var with `ACCOUNT_KEY` as the key and the username/password for your dummy account as the value. 
8. Go back up to Resources. Under Dynos, select worker.
9. Go to [Heroku Postgres](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) and click Install. Add the database to the Heroku app.
10. The database should now be viewable from the Overview tab, click on the database
11. Go to the Settings tab for the database and View Credentials, save this information somewhere

#### PostgreSQL Setup

1. Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) locally
2. Launch SQL Shell
3. Follow prompts and enter in the data given from the last step on the Heroku setup
4. Paste the following code into command prompt

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
            discord_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
            leetcode_username TEXT NOT NULL,
            num_total INTEGER NOT NULL,
            num_easy INTEGER NOT NULL,
            num_medium INTEGER NOT NULL,
            num_hard INTEGER NOT NULL,
            total_subs INTEGER NOT NULL
        );
```

After following these steps, the bot should run!
